
Version Control - CVS

Before Aqua Data Studio's CVS client Before Aqua Data Studio's CVS client can be used, there must first be a remote CVS file repository for it to communicate with and a local mount created in the Files Browser for the local client repository. If there is no mount currently listed in the Files Browser, right clicking and choosing "Checkout Project" will generate a local mount to place the checkout in. For an explanation of how the Files Browser displays version control status, see the screenshot and discussion in the Files Browser page within the Workspace and Docking Framework section.

How to mount a Version Control repository 
Outside of ADS, create or find a directory for use with CVS or Subversion. This will become your client repository.
Within ADS, mount the directory from within the Scripts pane by right clicking and selecting Mount Directory.
Right click on the directory within the Scripts pane and select Version Control > Configure from the drop down.
Input the correct settings for your Version Control server. If "Checkout Module" is selected, the module will update immediately.
How to Commit changes
Within the Scripts pane, right click on the client repository, select Version Control, select Commit.
A window appears with a listing of all of the files within the client repository which includes the location, file extension and status within version control. Check all of the files you wish to commit to the Version Control server.
